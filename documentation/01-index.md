The FEC Pattern Library is a collection of styles and design patterns that capture the design language and practices that make <a href="https://www.fec.gov">FEC.gov</a>.
This pattern library should:
 - Promote consistency across digital interfaces
 - Document best practices
 - Outline when, where, why, and how to use these patterns
 - Provide a testing area to prototype and build new patterns, or predictably edit existing patterns

It should enable developers to quickly replicate components, and designers to focus more on improving the user experience than choosing the styling.

### Documentation
The Typography, Colors, Grid, and Icons sections contain the foundational style guidance for the design language used across patterns.

### Components
Components are small basic building blocks that are used to build larger features or layouts.
