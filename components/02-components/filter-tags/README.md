Filter tags help users track and confirm which filters have been applied when they are sorting through a list or table of results. Since tags are generated by applying filters, they also create another mechanism by which users can remove applied filters. Tags aren’t removable when they apply strict limits to the data being viewed, such as a two-year period search.
